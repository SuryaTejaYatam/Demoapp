  <h2 id="dd" style="text-align: center"> POLITICAL CAREER </h2>
  <p>
  <strong>Praja Rajyam Party</strong>  <br>
Kalyan started his political career in 2008[51] as the president of Yuvarajyam,[52] the youth wing of Praja Rajyam Party which was started by his elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[53] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party[54] with Congress,[55] Kalyan took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with his brother's decision to merge the party,[56] and started a new political party in 2014 called Jana Sena Party.

He opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in Hindi).[60] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[61] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017 once he completes his film commitments.[62]
    
    "Pawan Kalyan's talk touched my heart. My soul said that if there are youth like Pawan Kalyan, the Telugu spirit can never die. Telangana and Seemandhra can both prosper under someone like him."
    
    —Prime Minister Narendra Modi about Kalyan[63]
    He brought the Uddanam kidney disease crisis to the attention of media and politicians through protests and a hunger strike. Government of Andhra Pradesh responded by constructing dialysis centers and implementing various schemes for the village.[64][65] In November 2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will contest in the 2019 general elections in Andhra Pradesh.[66] He stated that he was planning to contest from all 175 legislatures of Andhra Pradesh without any alliance.[67] He opposed central government's move to privatise Dredging Corporation of India (DCI)[68] on a golden platter.[69] Kalyan led a protest march to condolence farmers who committed suicides or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema.[70] He opposed the TDP Government's decision on land pooling.[71] Kalyan conducted a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage in Rajahmundry demanding political accountability.[72] He exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserve forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu in East Godavari district.[73]</p>
